# Plucker

This is a library to get a set a values plucked from a list of sObject. It also contains a helper method to group a records by a given field.

## Notes
Instance methods are used instead of static methods to allow for mocking in tests. 

Nulls are skipped and not included in the sets.

Why isn't this a package? There's no guarantee that I will continue maintaining any package, which could potentially create a dependency in your org that can never be updated. This could be especially problematic if there is a security update. You could manage this dependency using submodules in your org. Plus this allows you to fork the repo, customize, and maintain it yourself should you need to.
